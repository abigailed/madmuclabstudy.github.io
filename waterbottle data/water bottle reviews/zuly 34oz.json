  "reviewDescription": "Absolutely love my new copper water containers. Beautifully crafted. Arrived sooner than I expected. I have gotten so many compliments on them. They are easy to clean and letting water sit in them overnight you can really taste the difference. I will order more as gifts. Wish I hadn't waited so long or I could have given out for xmas. Makes drinking water so much more fun."

  "reviewDescription": "Very beautiful, always getting compliments. If the top is not on tight will leak otherwise is very leak proof. I have had it for a few weeks and the top has begun to ruay it's time to wash it. But I've kept water in it day and night. Keeps cold water cold, love it."
