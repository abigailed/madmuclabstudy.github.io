  "reviewDescription": "i was looking for a water bottle that was big and metal! i didn't want it to be too big to carry or too small to frequently fill up all the time. this is a 32oz bottle and suits my needs perfectly! i love the straw sippy cap (it comes with multiple different caps) i can take it to the gym or out walking. it's like my new best friend bc i take it everywhere i go lol, and it's super cute! i def recommend this one if you're looking at reviews for diff water bottles however!! it's hand wash only! it is easy to clean, but its something to keep in mind"
