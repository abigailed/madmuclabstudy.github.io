  "reviewDescription": "This water bottle is perfect for keeping me hydrated all day long. Its large capacity means I don’t have to refill it constantly, which is super convenient, especially during workouts. The handle is sturdy and makes it easy to carry around, and I haven’t had any issues with leaks. It’s become an essential part of my daily routine!"

  "reviewTitle": "Will not buy again",
  "reviewDescription": "A very weird bottle. It is very sturdy however it has a hole in the top so when you drink from it water splashes you ... It also grows mold in side quite quickly so you need to clean it very often. Will not buy again"
