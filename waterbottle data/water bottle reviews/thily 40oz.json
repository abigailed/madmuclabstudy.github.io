  "reviewDescription": "The bottle isn’t leakproof at all. I had it propped up in my bag and by the time I walked 15 mins to the gym, it leaked all over my shoes. It functions fine enough otherwise. I would return but it’s too much of a hassle. It doesn’t keep my water as cold as other tumblers or bottles do."

  "reviewDescription": "I love this bottle, it keeps things cold for several hours and I love the ouside design. I was looking for a 40oz bottle without a side handle and fits in my car cup holder and this one fits the bill plus more. I love purple and this one is lovely shade of wite with purple petal detail. I would buy this bottle again!"
