  "reviewDescription": "I bring this bubba with me pretty much everywhere. It holds 40oz of whatever liquid you want to put in it. The design is smooth and durable and you're able to use one hand to hold while drinking from it.. The lid is spring action; you push a button and it will pop open. If you are worried that it might open accidently, there is a little latch that prevents you from opening the bottle. In addition it has an attached handle that makes it easier to carry. Overall, this is a great product that I would recommend."

  "reviewDescription": "The top has a spring loaded top, where the spring action can break, also the locking mechanism on the cap is quite brittle. Otherwise the bottle itself is very sturdy"
