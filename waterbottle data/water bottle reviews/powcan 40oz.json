  "reviewTitle": "An Okay Bottle",
  "reviewDescription": "This water bottle does a decent job at keeping drinks at the right temperature and has a stylish appearance, especially in the oat/yellow color. It’s great for drinking water, and the straw feels pretty standard—nothing too special, but it gets the job done. However, there are a few problems. The chug cap is a bit difficult to twist on and off, which can be inconvenient. Additionally, there’s a slight metallic or rubber-like taste that can be noticeable while drinking. When it comes to hot drinks like cappuccinos or tea, I wouldn’t say this is the best option. If you do use it for hot liquids, be sure to leave the lid open for a few minutes after pouring. Otherwise, the heat buildup can cause the drink to spill out when you open the straw. Overall, it’s a decent thermal bottle—not amazing, but not bad either. If you’re mainly using it for water, it should work just fine."

  "reviewDescription": "Forget Stanley, POWCAN has life time warranty and fantastic customer service. I asked questions and they responded right away with answers. The straw is great for no distraction while driving, and the chug for any other times. I got a second one, just know the 26oz fits cup holders."

  "reviewDescription": "I've been looking for a bottle that can carry a lot of water, but still be light enough to carry around. This 40oz bottle is perfect! I also prefer this handle because it's easier on the wrists when carrying compared to the side handle. The cotton candy colour is exactly as advertised. Love it! My sister also bought one and loves it too!"

  "reviewDescription": "I've dinged this bottle around a few times and the colour hasn't chipped or scratch. Well-designed, fits in your cup holder but holds a good amount of water. The \"handle\" makes it easier to tote around, and the spout is shaped in an ergonomic way for optimal pouring into one's mouth. I don't use the straw very often, but seems to do what it's supposed to do. Quality water bottle at a decent price!"
