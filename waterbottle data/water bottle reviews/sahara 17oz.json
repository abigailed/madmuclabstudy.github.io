  "reviewTitle": "Very pretty, sturdy and works well.",
  "reviewDescription": "I really like it. Pretty colour and you can actually see the writing on it unlike other bottles. So far seems leak proof to me. Nice it contains an extra rubber seal I wasn't expecting that and special brush for cleaning. I got the small one as it's a perfect size to toss in your purse when you're just out and about and don't need a great big one. The hand strap is nice but gets in the way when washing and isn't removable... and it's unnecessary when their is a flip up carrier (which I didn't even know about until I saw one of the review videos) the blue plastic thing in the bottle attaches to the cleaning brush handle in case anyone else is confused lol. There are no instructions in the box, I thought does this tool help you remove the strap? But no lol the strap doesn't come off."

  "reviewTitle": "Perfect Motivational Water Bottle!",
  "reviewDescription": "I was very impressed with the quality of this water bottle. Loved the vibrant color, the drinking spout was a good size and the carrying strap is convenient. The indicators help to keep me on track throughout the day. They included a cleaning brush, which is very handy and was a nice surprise. The bottle is hand wash only but that is how I would wash it anyway. I would highly recommend this product!"
