  "reviewDescription": "I bought this water bottle for my wife and she absuloutly loved it. The colour that we chose looks very nice and bold, but it does look a little bit different from the picture so that's why I attached my own image. Even though this mug is very big, it fits in cup holders very easily which is beneficial for traveling. Due to its 40oz volume, it holds lots of water and it makes sure you drink enough water without refilling it to many times. You can also buy accessories for this tumbler like a divider that can go inside so you can fit two different drinks inside, or covers for the bottom to prevent getting scratched. This tumbler keeps your drinks hot or cold for large amounts of time due to its vacume insulation. This cup also has very minimal leaks which is very handy as well. Of course water will spill through the straw, which is why there is a lid that goes over top of the hole that the straw goes into. However it would be handy if there was a straw holder at the side of the cup to prevent the straw from getting lost or dirty while not in the cup. If you do not want to drink with the straw, there is another lid that you can uncover to drink without the straw. In addition Contigo is overall a very good brand with great prices and is definitely underrated."

  "reviewDescription": "Really impressed with this Contigo tumbler. It fits perfectly in standard car cupholders, which is a big plus for me. It keeps drinks cold for hours, and I love that there’s no condensation on the outside. It feels sturdy, looks sleek, and does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Highly recommend."
