  "reviewTitle": "Extremely durable and amazing customer service!",
  "reviewDescription": "Best insulated bottle I have ever purchased! I purchased this bottle a year ago and have been using it pretty much every day since. I absolutely love the colour of it, and it comes with 3 different lids including one with a straw, one with a carabeener for your backpack, and a coffee style one. This keeps my water cool for 24 hours minimum - more so if I add a few cubes of ice. It's not the lightest bottle, but it fits in all the gym cupholders and is super portable. Very recently, the silicone part came off the straw lid and I couldn't find it. The bottle was still in working order, however without the silicone mouth piece it was kinda uncomfortable to drink from and also a spill risk. I was super gutted about it! Although it was a year since I purchased it, I reached out to the customer service through the Amazon messaging feature, and asked could I purchased the silicone mouth piece. They were so prompt and helpful and actually sent me out a replacement bottle instead! I'm delighted as I now have a second one of these amazing bottles that I can use for hiking and the outdoors - I just use one of the other lids provided for it! 10/10 for the bottle and customer service!"
