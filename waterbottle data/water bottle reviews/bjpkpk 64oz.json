  "reviewDescription": "Great size, no longer need to constantly refill my water and keeps it cold from a pretty long time as well. The only downside I'd say is the screw cap could be easier to unscrew as sometimes it gets a bit stuck. But overall happy with my purchase."

  "reviewTitle": "Very good thermos",
  "reviewDescription": "Great insulation, put ice and water in it and there is still some ice the day after. Goes in the dishwasher. But it is difficult to tight it completely to prevent water to leak from bellow the lid so I prefer filling it from the small cap."
