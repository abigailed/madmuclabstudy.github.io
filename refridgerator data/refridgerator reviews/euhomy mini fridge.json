  "reviewDescription": "This mini fridge is exceptional. Feels sturdy, nice seal around the fridge & freezer, super quiet, super cold. Plenty of space, but still compact. I took a tray out to fit taller drinks. Easily able to fit over a dozen standard bottles. My crisper has 3 “lunchable” style snack trays, 2 big boxes of peeps, 32 sticks of string cheese, crab dip, and some other things. My freezer has 2 qts and a pint of ice cream, and 2 boxes of outshine bars. Still have room AND the door space left. This thing is great, highly recommend. See photos for space."
