  "reviewDescription": "Refrigerator is NOT cooling even after turning it all the way up past 5. Freezer is freezing some ice cream to rock hard but the refrigerator's lower section is barely 60 degrees. Had it for almost a week and tried everything and read all directions with no luck. Not happy."

  "reviewDescription": "terrible packaging as it came dented, the bottom adjustable leg was bent and couldn't get the cap on it, on the side there were scratches and there were spots on the side that weren't thoroughly painted. Amozan would have sent me another one, but didn't want to repackage and send back, so I kept it . But love the style and so does everyone that sees it."

  "reviewDescription": "It came with so many scratches and big dents, and somehow the fridge door seems uneven? Returning is going to be such an annoying hassle so will be just using it but a pretty disappointing and unsatisfying purchase."

  "reviewDescription": "Super cute fridge. I'm disappointed in the packing. The packaging was in ruff shape when it showed up. It has a dent on the side and a scratch on the front. I can kind of look past those two things, not that I want to. The worst is it had a missing adjustable foot on the left side and the one behind is bent. So frustrating on buying something new. It runs well and gets cold so that's good. Bigger than I thought and can hold quite a bit. Really don't want to return such a big item."

  "reviewDescription": "The refrigerator has major damage â€” huge dent on the side to the door and main body. Lots of scratches, with some quite deep that cut through the enamel finish. I worry those scratches will rust. The refrigerator appears to work. I dont know how to exchange or send this back. I do not recommend."

  "reviewDescription": "The refrigerator bottom door is damaged thereâ€™s a big dent in it. There was hardly any Styrofoam or packaging protecting the item while it was inside the box. Pictured is all the Styrofoam that was contained inside the box to protect the refrigerator which amounts to absolutely nothing I want a new item that is not damaged."
