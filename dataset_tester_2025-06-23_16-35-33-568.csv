Battery life is impressive too — it lasts a full day under normal use. So far, the experience has been great, especially for light work and study needs. However, if you plan to do heavy gaming or demanding tasks, you might want to look at a higher-end model. For the price, it offers great value and is definitely worth considering.","RR5XIEI4WM38Q","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711e8lcaQ0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MlK45TcIL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rlZRmXD9L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Great laptop, I like it!","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/RR5XIEI4WM38Q","Reviewed in Canada on April 30, 2025","48","45",,,"Size: 15.6in N97 16GB DDR4 512GB SSD","B0F1KJ4L8Q","Size","15.6in N97 16GB DDR4 512GB SSD"

I like it seems pretty powerful for its size. I found it only to be 3.5 inches side to side and 1.7 inches tall. It is very portable and I like I can easily take it with me almost anywhere. I like it connected to my internet fast and easily. I like the CPU is 3.4 GHz. I had to wait for a couple of updates to load on the machine. I found it fast to download updates. I found it fast on boot and fast to load. I like it loaded my videos and played well. I found the audio good that came through the TV and the monitor. I posted a video but there is sound in the background from house noise. I like that it has Windows 11 pro on it. I think it is beneficial for my work. I like the size of the memory that it has on the ssd. It is 265 gb and that is enough for what I need. I like all the multiple ports that are on the machine. I found all to work well when tested. I like that I can have up to three monitors connected to the computer at one time, though I only use two right now. It also has duel Ethernet ports on the computer. It has a audio port and also 3 usb ports. I like all 3 ports are 3.2 and I found all to work well. I like it supports 2.4G and 5G wifi. Both worked well. I like that it has wake up built in and it automatically will come on when I move my mouse. Also I have to mention that it is a power saver. It uses less power and it doesn’t take away from the machines performance. I like the built in fan that keeps it cool. It is very quiet and not noisy while running. I had no problem with connecting to the blue-tooth 4.2. It was easy for me to do. It supports HDMI 4k so my picture is clear on the monitors and also on my big screen 4k TV. I found the vesa mount a plus for hiding the computer but it is so small and cute do I really want too? I have enclosed pictures and a short video so you can make an informed decision based on your own personal needs. Yes, I would recommend this product.","R3UBZBFP0FJMC","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Nt9MnNLeL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RUUhNtgVL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CcqbU3GBL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FNLlaompL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HkfhxxybL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JfiTNZSjL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Js2ygY6xL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RjLN8P6gL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T22Xd8ZEL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61X09wAfyEL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XaDqq2m2L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hUziW2JCL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lt1HIE50L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tSHnq2hzL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tgokHFvWL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61x8vBBOXFL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yFo+NfpyL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710-dxibzjL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7137aLcFx9L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Eg3at90sL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71H4NRbfMLL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QZSb+ehkL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SavRvwaqL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gTfh4HqRL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hXsUzBnAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uQC77ecGL._SY88.jpg","2","Fast and very portable","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R3UBZBFP0FJMC","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

Searching AceMagic's vendor page the only Mini PC that comes up is product B0CCY8MMHB, https://www.amazon.com/Processor-Desktop-Computer-Bluetooth-Business/dp/B0CCY8MMHB?ref_=ast_sto_dp also known as Mini PC RGB AK1 Plus, Intel N95(up to 3.4GHz) 12th Gen Processor Mini Desktop Computer, 16GB RAM 512GB SSD, Dual 4K HDMI, Windows 11 Small PC, 2.4/5G WiFi, Bluetooth, Business/Office/HTPC for $259.00. This Mini PC Intel 12th Gen N95 has dual 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports in the back, 3 USB ports on the side and 3 HDMI ports on the other side. It's funny because the instruction manual says to use either HDMI, USB C, or DisplayPort when none of those save HDMI is available on this device. It's truly the strangest device for a miniature PC that I've ever seen! Specs are 8 GB DDR5 RAM, a 256 GB SSD of some sort, Wifi 6, and Win 11 Pro preinstalled, nothing able to be upgraded as far as I can tell from CPU-Z or Speccy which are programs that can be run to tell you about a computer. The power cord looks like a phone charger which is nice considering the size of the brick that comes with my larger NUC 12 which looks like a laptop charger! It's about 25% smaller than my NUC and makes less noise. It comes with an HDMI cable. A USB Mouse and USB keyboard are needed but not included. It's quick and snappy for a 15 TDP processor and is slightly ""slower"" in terms of processing power than my i7 2700k from 2011 but faster since my i7 didn't have DDR5 RAM or a modern SSD! For $199.99 I would say that it's worth it even though it's NOT upgradeable however, seeing as how the product has disappeared from Amazon, I'd say go for the Mini PC which has the same N95 Alder Lake processor, 16 GB but only DDR4 RAM, and a larger 512 GB SSD for $259.00. Overall rating: 4 Stars but only because it's mysteriously not available anymore? Value for money: 5 Stars Light weight: 5 Stars Battery life: I can't rate this because it's not a laptop, it's a Mini PC which requires a constant power connection.","R12ISGIQ562OZV","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6143jzSpCbL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616OEwtbyvL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61M8li8lkmL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h4YqYLdBL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61i4svRhXWL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k36ZCnJjL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+oCkD9eZL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71glkDeVg7L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iJ9aA5sQL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lZwK72HNL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nP8Lq46UL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mysteriously not available but it would be worth it if you can find it!","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R12ISGIQ562OZV","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

This is definitely the lightest laptop I've ever owned and can be picked by one hand with ease. The monitor is a great size for watching movies, surfing the web, and writing emails. Everything I've run on this computer has looked very clean and clear. Movies are a pleasure to watch with this because of the crisp video. The battery life is impressive as I can get a get few hours in before it needs charging. This laptop doesn't have a touch screen, but I personally don't like those anyway. The only thing I wish this computer had was a keyboard that lights up when using it. While working in low light (or the dark) I have to use the brightness of the screen to see the keys on the keyboard. That's a slight bummer, but I can live with it. The actual keyboard keys have a great feel when you're typing and the letters are in a large print and very easy to read. I love that it has a separate numeric keypad on the side. All the websites I visit load up fast and clear (it has 16GB of Ram), and as I said before, movies run and look fantastic. The CPU speed is 3.4 Ghz. I ran one of those computer benchmark programs and this laptop scored higher than most. As for gaming, this laptop should be able to run most regular games. The speakers produce a good volume level as I can hear my movies clearly even when I have a fan running close by. So far I'm having a great experience with this and would gladly recommend it. It wasn't the smoothest set up for me, but that was a Windows 11 issue and had nothing to do with this laptop. Overall, this is a great laptop, at a great price.","REIWG0BEM2LG2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","Great laptop at a great price","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/REIWG0BEM2LG2","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

I actually got this product to use as a remote desktop for my Apple Silicon MacBook to use certain Windows productivity apps that I need which aren't available for MacOS. Honestly, it was cheaper than buying Parallels emulation software and a Windows license. This mini PC shipped with Windows 11 Pro, which is a significant plus over the home version because it includes some extras like BitLocker encryption, virtual machines, and corporate-friendly features like domain support. Upon unboxing the mini PC, it was smaller than expected. I guess that I imagined something like a cube, but it is much shorter, about the size of an Apple TV. It is seriously packed with great ports: dual gigabit LAN, 3 HDMI, 3 USB 3.2 type A, and a headphone jack. Installation was pretty straightforward - it booted up fast, although annoyingly Windows setup did not look/detect the wireless network (perhaps best to setup on the LAN). Not sure if this is a common issue with this Windows build because there is a sticker on the chassis talking about disabling WiFi, but the mini PC did connect to the wireless easily after setup was completed. I'm guessing this is purpose built with the corporate conference room in mind, or for use cases where you need a PC running multiple displays all day like at a restaurant menu bank or at the airport. It includes a VESA mounting kit and has 3 - count 'em - HDMI ports. According to the manufacturer's web site, you can run 3 separate displays in extend mode, likely in 1920x1080 resolution (I was not able to test this feature). With 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, it ran Microsoft Office 365 and some similar productivity apps just fine. Web browsing and streaming video worked great. I wouldn't use this for intensive photo or video editing, but this little processor is surprisingly capable for the average user. The variable speed cooling fan system is on the bottom of the box (it is raised on feet - you wouldn't want to cover it up). The fan seems to always be running, but at the lowest speed it is barely noticeable, no more than your average Windows laptop. It's not clear to me if the RAM and SSD are upgradeable or soldered into the motherboard like a laptop. The included 'manual' is fairly useless and I didn't try opening the chassis.","RMW701HZL6DG5","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bBWXbCIoL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pNG20SvsL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61txFE-HIML._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aXBz+CSPL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Impressive 12th Gen Alder Lake N95 mini PC","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/RMW701HZL6DG5","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

This form factor is perfect to use as a media center, as it runs quiet enough to not disturb movies, and is small enough to mount directly to the back of your TV. It even includes a vesa-compatible mounting system specifically for this. The processor is snappy, and the built-in storage is pretty quick feeling as well. My only real concern with this is the OS install that came on it - several apps had already been installed, and the setup process clearly skipped right past all the usual registration portions you typically find when installing a new computer. Personally, I'm going to install a different operating system on this and use it as a media streamer, so I'm not too concerned with the os that ships on it - however, if you are planning to run the os that ships on it, I strongly recommend you reset and erase all user data before you ever connect this to your home network.","R1C4RRWDFVDV9M","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NhyeJ0AGL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IJzfuYnAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LaKhJsjiL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N7q+WW52L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ON+09EEzL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Wh-7kZhGL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u834l8IJL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xUn7BVtdL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hardware has exceeded my expectations.","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1C4RRWDFVDV9M","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

I primarily use Mac but on occasion I need a PC for specific programs or hardware. I had been using an 11 year old Toshiba i7 monster of a laptop that was on its last leg. I was looking for a replacement and I ordered the Acemagic even though I had concerns about the speed of the processor. I was excited to get the new laptop and was amazed by the look of it and the performance for a sub $350.00 laptop. I do not game with it or run anything to taxing such as video editing or database programs. It is primarily for browsing and running a few PC specific programs. It has everything you need for connection to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It has all the ports you could possibly want. It also includes an excellent IPS screen that is full HD. One of the best things in my opinion is that it can easily be upgraded. The bottom case is removable and the SSD, memory and Wi-Fi card can all be upgraded. The laptop boots fast and I never get the feeling the processor is slowing the laptop down. This would be a perfect laptop for school age kids all the way through college. It is a perfect home laptop because it is fast and includes the Windows 11 Pro operating system. The Acemagic is also quite slim at 2/3 of an inch and weighs less than 4 pounds. In this price range this laptop really shines and I am glad I ordered it.","R2PG99IPIPI0DQ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Excellent inexpensive laptop","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2PG99IPIPI0DQ","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

About 4430 in Night Raid, 1000 in Fire Strike, and 340 in Time Spy. Not that it matters much for the likely use of such a PC, but it is good to have data. The ad when I ordered (and still does at the time of writing) showed an image of a 256GB eMMC module on the motherboard, however after opening it up and looking around, I didn't see one. Instead, the m.2 SATA slot was already populated with a 256GB drive. At least it is easily replaceable with a larger one if needed, but it will mean the inconvenience of reinstalling the OS.

You can research it and see the corrective actions the company took - and this, in my opinion, is all good news. When I got the laptop, I went ahead with firing it up and setting up Windows 11 Home, which is what this one had. I was cautious about passwords and such to be safe that I do not use anything I already might... and I continued setup to get to the Windows Security section in settings. I then ran the Defender Scans (quick first, then FULL, and Offline)... all three scans came back clean, and I run them every now and again as well. With all that said, once I got things setup, the computer works very quickly and smoothly. The CASE that it is in, the body of the laptop feels pretty good, but the mousepad on this one kind of made it feel a little cheap, but it works flawlessly. When I went to download Chrome, the system has a pop up along the lines of ""You don't need Chrome..."" I found that to be quite clever... but yeah, I need Chrome - I ALSO use Edge, so it doesn't matter... the Mini Computer I have did not do that, but it has Windows 11 Pro. I installed Chrome and was moving along very well. I triple checked when the system was updated, and it informed me that it was in April 2024, much after the previous issues had been being addressed. With that information, along with ACEMAGIC articles explaining the situation, I am satisfied that my scans provide me with enough security to use this laptop well. I give this one five stars, but also advise to check the specifications of the unit, and do some comparative research on the specs v. end unit cost to make sure that you are getting what you want at a fair price point.","R31KIIQ9G9X20J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","Only talking about how it works here.","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R31KIIQ9G9X20J","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

Set up was reasonably easy, other than the issue entering the pin, but that is apparently a Windows issue (you get a lot of results if you search online). There is a sticker on the laptop suggesting turning wifi off, which would let you skip that, or you can do what I did: when you get the point where there should be a prompt to enter your pin, hit alt-tab until the entry window is highlight, then type your pin, hit tab, type your pin, then hit enter. The entry screen never comes to the front, but that lets you enter your information. Load times are fast. The screen is bright and sharp, and colors seem true. The keyboard is decent, just a typical laptop keyboard. The touchpad is large and sensitive, but there is no button to turn it off, which can be annoying if you have a mouse hooked up. I put Minecraft on it to try it out, and was surprised that it worked well. Without a discrete graphics card, anything more intensive probably would not be playable.","RVWZNPFUCW9B3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nice portable laptop","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/RVWZNPFUCW9B3","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,

I installed Microsoft 365, tax software etc., which were all running fast and smoothly. What I liked: • CPU speed is fast enough for my home office use • 16 GB RAM is sufficient for multiple apps to run simultaneously, for example, running Word, Excel and web browser simultaneously • 512GB SSD is good size to store a lot of documents, photos and videos • Bright 15.6 inch screen • Battery capacity lasts for hours after being fully charged • Windows 11 Professional • Lightweight Some caveats: • Wifi adapter is very slow as compared to my other laptops, and iPhone. The Wifi adapter of this laptop only achieved 25% of download speed with the same Wifi router and same channel while its driver is already up to date • Initial setup was a challenge. I was unable to use my Microsoft account for the initial setup, the setup stuck during authentication. As the warning label suggested, I must turn off Wifi and create a local admin account during initial setup. For recovery purpose, I created second local admin account I have been using this laptop for a few weeks. In overall, it performed ok and stable. It’s great value for its specs. Meanwhile, I’m considering getting an external Wifi adapter to resolve the slow Wifi adapter issue.","R216GJ8Q7QA815","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YP5SkRk9L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ibQRIOHML._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fhgbJFPYL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Great value for the specs with slow Wifi adapter and some setup issues","https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R216GJ8Q7QA815","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","48","45",,,"","B0F1KJ4L8Q",,
